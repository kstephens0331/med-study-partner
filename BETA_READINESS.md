## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues - Must Fix Before Beta

### 1. Railway Services Are Down (CRITICAL)
**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKING

Both backend services are returning 502 errors:
- **Transcriber Service:** https://med-study-transcriber-production.up.railway.app/transcribe
- **Ingestor Service:** https://med-study-ingestor-production.up.railway.app/extract

**Impact:**
- Cannot upload PDF/PPTX materials (will fail silently or error)
- Lecture mode transcription may fail if it uses this service

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Check Railway service logs and status
railway status
railway logs

# Restart services if needed
railway up --service transcriber
railway up --service ingestor
```

### 2. Apply Latest Database Migration
**Status:** üü° IMPORTANT

The RLS optimization migration needs to be applied manually:

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250103000000_optimize_rls_policies.sql`

**Action Required:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the entire migration file
3. Execute the migration
4. Verify no errors

**Why It Matters:**
- Significantly improves query performance at scale
- Fixes 50+ performance warnings from Supabase linter
- Prevents unnecessary re-evaluation of auth.uid() for every row

## üìã Recommended Before Beta (Optional but Advised)

### 1. Testing Checklist
- [ ] **End-to-End User Flow Test**
  - Create new account
  - Complete onboarding modal
  - Upload a material (PDF/PPTX)
  - Create a flashcard
  - Review the flashcard
  - Use Quick Mode AI coach
  - Use Lecture Mode
  - Generate a vignette
  - Logout and login again

- [ ] **Error Scenario Testing**
  - Try uploading invalid file types
  - Try reviewing with no cards available
  - Test session expiration handling
  - Test network failure scenarios

### 2. Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] **Set up Vercel Analytics** (if not already done)
  - Track page views and user flows
  - Monitor performance metrics

- [ ] **Supabase Monitoring**
  - Check database connection limits
  - Monitor query performance
  - Review RLS policy execution times

- [ ] **Error Tracking** (Optional)
  - Consider adding Sentry or similar for production error tracking
  - Would help catch issues before users report them

### 3. Documentation for Beta Testers
- [ ] **User Guide** (Quick Start)
  - How to create an account
  - Overview of each tab
  - Best practices for using AI Coach
  - How to create and review flashcards

- [ ] **Known Limitations**
  - Voice recognition requires Chrome/Edge (Web Speech API)
  - Material upload limited to PDF/PPTX
  - TTS may have delays on slower connections

### 4. Performance Considerations
- [ ] **Rate Limiting** (Optional but recommended)
  - Consider adding rate limits on API routes
  - Prevent abuse of AI coach endpoints
  - Protect against excessive Together.ai API usage

- [ ] **Caching Strategy**
  - Current skill tracking has 1-minute cache (good)
  - Consider caching materials list
  - Consider caching due cards query

### 5. Security Review
- [x] RLS policies in place (all tables)
- [x] Authentication required for all routes
- [x] Service role key not exposed to client
- [ ] Review CORS settings for Railway services
- [ ] Consider adding request validation middleware
