## ✅ RECENT FIXES COMPLETED (This Session)

### 1. RLS Performance Optimization ✅
**Problem:** Supabase linter showing 50+ warnings about `auth.uid()` re-evaluation
**Solution:** Created migration file that wraps all `auth.uid()` in `(select auth.uid())`
**Status:** Migration file created at `supabase/migrations/20250103000000_optimize_rls_policies.sql`
**Action Required:** You need to manually run this in Supabase SQL Editor

### 2. Git Repository Cleanup ✅
**Problem:** Couldn't push to GitHub - node_modules (122MB file) was committed
**Solution:**
- Removed node_modules from git tracking
- Cleaned git history with filter-branch
- Configured med-study-partner as proper submodule
- Force pushed cleaned repository
**Status:** ✅ Repository now clean and pushable

### 3. API Authentication Fix ✅
**Problem:** `/api/materials` endpoint returning 500 errors
**Solution:** Updated `src/middleware.ts` to exclude `/api/*` routes from auth middleware
**Status:** ✅ Fixed, tested, and deployed to Vercel

### 4. Railway Configuration Files Created ✅
**Files Created:**
- `src/transcriber/railway.json` - Docker build configuration
- `src/ingestor/railway.json` - Docker build configuration
- `src/transcriber/requirements.txt` - Added `python-multipart==0.0.9`
- `src/ingestor/requirements.txt` - Added `python-multipart==0.0.9`

**Status:** ✅ All files committed to `master` branch

## ⏳ CURRENT BLOCKER - Railway Services Deployment

### The Issue
Both Railway services (transcriber and ingestor) are failing to deploy with error:
```
Dockerfile `Dockerfile` does not exist
```

### What We Know
- ✓ Files exist in correct locations on master branch:
  - `src/transcriber/Dockerfile`
  - `src/transcriber/railway.json`
  - `src/ingestor/Dockerfile`
  - `src/ingestor/railway.json`
- ✓ Railway dashboard settings configured:
  - Branch: `master` ✓
  - Root Directory: `src/transcriber` ✓
- ✓ Railway is reading railway.json (shows "value is set in railway.json")
- ✗ Railway Builder setting may need manual UI configuration

### What Needs to Happen
**In Railway Dashboard for EACH service (transcriber and ingestor):**

1. Go to Settings tab
2. Find "Build" or "Builder" section
3. **Manually set Builder dropdown to: DOCKERFILE**
4. Set Dockerfile Path to: `Dockerfile` (or leave empty)
5. Click Save
6. Wait 5-7 minutes for build
7. Test health endpoint

### Expected Services
- **Transcriber:** `https://med-study-transcriber-production.up.railway.app/health`
- **Ingestor:** `https://med-study-ingestor-production.up.railway.app/health`

Both should return: `{"status":"ok"}` or similar (NOT 502 error)

   - URL: https://railway.app/dashboard
   - Select Transcriber service

2. **Configure Builder (2 minutes):**
   - Settings → Build section
   - Set Builder to: DOCKERFILE
   - Save and wait for deployment

3. **Repeat for Ingestor (2 minutes):**
   - Same steps with Ingestor service

   - Should see "Building Docker image" not "npm ci"

5. **Test Services:**
   ```bash
   curl https://med-study-transcriber-production.up.railway.app/health
   curl https://med-study-ingestor-production.up.railway.app/health
   ```

6. **Apply RLS Migration:**
   - Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor

## 💡 TROUBLESHOOTING REFERENCE

### If Railway Still Fails After Setting Builder
Try the "Nuclear Option" in [RAILWAY_BUILDER_FIX.md](RAILWAY_BUILDER_FIX.md:19):
1. Delete the Railway service
2. Create new service from GitHub
3. Set Root Directory during creation: `src/transcriber`
4. Railway should auto-detect Dockerfile

### If Migration Fails
- Check Supabase dashboard for conflicts
- Can roll back with: `DROP POLICY` commands
- Migration is idempotent (safe to re-run)

### If Health Checks Fail After Deployment
- Check Railway logs for startup errors
- Verify PORT environment variable is set
- Check python-multipart is installed (should be in requirements.txt)

---

## ✅ EVERYTHING IS READY

All code is written, all files are in place, all configurations are documented. The ONLY remaining work is:

1. **2 minutes:** Set Builder in Railway UI for transcriber
2. **2 minutes:** Set Builder in Railway UI for ingestor
3. **10 minutes:** Wait for services to build
4. **2 minutes:** Apply RLS migration in Supabase
5. **15 minutes:** End-to-end testing

**Total: ~30 minutes to 100% beta ready! 🚀**

**After your restart, start with Railway dashboard and refer to [RAILWAY_BUILDER_FIX.md](RAILWAY_BUILDER_FIX.md) for exact steps.**
